# Applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning
## Project Description




## Motivation
Reinforcement learning is a topic applicable to many, many problems in computer science and in robotics. We are interested in taking a broad survey of the field and focusing in on deep reinforcement learning. We hope to learn as much about the topic as we can in the time given, and use that knowledge to implement a deep RL agent to optimize reward in increasingly complex environments, culminating with an Atari game.

### Next Steps

documentation requirement:
Show it off: Describe the main idea of your project. What does your system do? Why would you want to do this? What are the major components to your system and how do they fit together? Hopefully you will have some cool videos to put in the website by this point.
System architecture: In detail describe each component of your project. Make sure to touch upon both code structure as well as algorithms.
