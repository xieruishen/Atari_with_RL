## Blog Post 1: Q Learning Reinforcement Model

###### 11/22/20

Back in 2013, DeepMind published the paper, *"Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning,"* which illustrated how a convolutional neural network could be trained with a variant of Q-Learning to play Atari video games. We hope to be able to replicate this result, and this page will follow the development progress of a deep RL agent to play Atari videogames. 

As a first step
